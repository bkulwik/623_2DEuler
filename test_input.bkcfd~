% This is a test input file for my 2D Euler Equation CFD Solver
% We ignore all lines that have double slashes to start
% First we define the cell number, then its left cell, right cell, top cell and bottom cell
% If there are no cells adjacent to it, then leave as "-"
%
% Alternately, we can just define the node number and location, then define cells from these nodes
% Yes, I like that last idea. Lets do that.
